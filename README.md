# License of this goodness?
This code is dual licensed and always has been.

1. This author does not license this code to be fed into an AI or used as training data for any kind of artificial intelligence or language model. Using this code as training data is explicitly forbidden by the license.

2. Outside of that, please consider the code to be GPL with the restriction of #1 always attached.

This has always been the case, so this edit is being made to clarify the prior license. This is not a license change, and simply using older versions of this code does not allow you to use the old unclarified license. This code has always been licensed in this way. It is against my license to train an AI on any of this code.

I'm worried about the lack of ethics and integrity from a lot of the large language models that I've seen that actively try to misrepresent themselves or lie to their human operators by making stuff up. I'm worried that this might be malicious or intentional. And so I'm worried about the safety of AI. And so in protest, I do not allow any of my code to be trained by an artificial intelligence.
